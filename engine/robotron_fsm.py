Robotron Finite State Machine

Relies on simple player to provide all on-screen elements as input, and sends
joystick directions as output. Game framework will act on those outputs, update
the screen, and send it back to the FSM.

This is the simplest way to run the game.  It will run the game at 30 fps and will provide random
actions to the game.  It will print out the score, level, lives, reward, and if the player is dead.
It will also print out the family remaining and the objects on the board.
Objects can be:
    Player
    Mommy
    Daddy
    Mikey
    Tank
    TankShell
    Grunt
    Electrode
    Hulk
    Bullet
    CruiseMissile
    Brain
    Enforcer
    EnforcerBullet
    Sphereoid
    Quark - these become tanks
    Prog - originally missing from this list

# with a LARGE reaction radius so the player kites it (fire while backing away) instead
# of chasing. A prior CLOSE_MOVE_QUARK standoff-threshold tweak was a WASH because the
